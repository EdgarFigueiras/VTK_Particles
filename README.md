# VTK_Particles
VTK library made for visualize probability clouds.

VTK library made for visualize probability clouds with C++.

Reads 3d data from an array with the format (x,y,z, Psi) and represents the data using particles.
The Psi value is represented using color degradation from blue (low probability) to red (high probability).
